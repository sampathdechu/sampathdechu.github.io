<h3 id="about-my-passion-and-expertise">About my passion and expertise:</h3>
<p>I am passionate about building technology solutions for boosting <em>employee productivity in enterprises</em>. My expertise lies in design, build and deployment of data-driven computational software solutions and platforms.</p>
<h3 id="about-my-technical-experience">About my technical experience:</h3>
<p>I have developed and delivered products that included advanced computational software methods  such as: <span style="color: blue"> <em>combinatorial search, numerical optimization, graph theory, data mining, statistical inference, natural language procesing, machine learning, deep learning</em></span>. I have experience of developing cloud-native fullstack applications using MEAN stack in microservice architecture.</p>
<h3 id="about-my-managerial-experience">About my managerial experience:</h3>
<p>I have experience of working in early stage startups as well as large organisations. I have setup and managed multi-disciplinary teams with researchers, data scientists, software engineers. I have collaborated with stakeholders across geographies for strategic and operational purposes. I have pivoted away from my comfort zone multiple times to new areas, quickly aquired new skills and delivered meaningful outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="about-my-approach">About my approach:</h3>
<p>My approach involves:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding business requirements and personas</li>
<li>Discover the opportunities for technology intervention</li>
<li>Exploration of technology stack (largely open source)</li>
<li>Evaluation of applicability of state of the art computational methods from academia</li>
<li>Minimum viable product design &amp; continuous validation with users.</li>
<li>Cloud-native solution build with agile practices</li>
<li>Persona based value metrics definition &amp; continuous monitoring for value realization.</li>
