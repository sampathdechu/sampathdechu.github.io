        At IBM research in Bangalore, I am responsible for research efforts in the areas of application of AI for business process automation and optimization. I lead the team of researchers, data scientists and software engineers to infuse AI into IBM offerings in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/in-en/automation">Automation</a> space. We have <span style="color:blue">10 published papers</span> in top rated peer-reviewed conferences and journals. We also have a <span style="color:blue">15 disclosures</span> filed at USPTO to protect the IP behind all the work. <br><br>
        The work we have been doing last few years had revenue impact of <span style="color:blue"> 150M USD </span> to IBM offerings.  Team's contributions differentiated IBM offerings in the market significantly and enabled new client wins for IBM managed services and IBM Cloud Pak for Automation offerings. We are working in the following technical areas: 
        <ul>
        <li> Process representation learning from structured, unstructured and semi-structured data artifacts from business process management systems. 
        <li> Comprehension and contextualization of natural langauge data artifacts for process discovery, monitoring and optimization
        <li> Applying AI for business process monitoring and automation opportunity discovery 
        <li> Process aware Auto-ML pipelines for prediction and recommendation tasks
        <li> Business goal-oriented data-driven decision recommendation systems
        <li> Causal inference for business process bottlenecks & counterfactual analysis of process optimization interventions. 
        <li> Natural language interfaces (chatbots) for business process orchestration. <br><br>

        In IBM systems lab in India, I was responsible for implementation of statistical methods for modeling and analysis of Digital Circuits. I built and led a team of 20 engineers with expertise in software development and electronics. Methods that we implemented led to more accurate yield prediction,  performance modeling and analysis especially  considering uncertainity during manufacturing process. <br><br>
        I was responsibile in laying out multi-year strategy for India team and executed the strategy with gradual rampup of the team's skills and delivering high-value development efforts from India team. <br><br>
        IBM pioneered in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2897937.2898068"> statistical analysis</a> of micro-processor (Mainframe and Power) designs. The work we did led to  <span style="color:blue"> 3X productivity improvement</span> in IBM processor design teams. Overall cost of development efforts reduced significantly since the development team was located in India. <br><br>

       The two startups I worked are in the area of development electronic design automation tools.  Electronic design automation is the set of software tools which are used to design complex electronic system circuits. In both the start ups, I had responsibility to apply techniques such as combinatorial search, graph analysis and numerical optimization for exploration of better design choices for digital circuits. <br><br>
       I have implemented optimization techniques for area reduction of digital circuits keeping the performance of the designs constant. This led to much lesser power consumption of the processors. The tool I have implemented was deployed at large hardware design and manufacturing companies e.g. Texas Instruments, TSMC, Samsung. The feature of the tool was licensed at 50K USD per license per annum. <br><br>

        I have implemented techniques for hierarchical graph modeling of digital circuits and traversal for detecting connectivity violations in digital circuits designs. These are critical validations that would need to be performed before digital designs are finalized for manufacturing. <br> <br>
